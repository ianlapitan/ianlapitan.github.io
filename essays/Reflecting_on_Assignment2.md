*Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details*

Assignment 2 builds on the store website that we made in Assignment 1. This portion of the project focuses on creating a login page in which the user is redirected to after making a purchase. They have the option to login if they have an account or register an account which we will have to save into our server. After logging in or registering the invoice should display the user's purchase. Here is the assignment details: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2.html

*What did you learn from this assignment?*

From this assignment, I learned how to save and transfer data after redirecting a user to a new page. This was something I struggled with for a while when working on this assignment, but with guidance I was able to achieve this. 

*Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).*

I did not work with a partner. 

*How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?*

After many trials and errors with transferring purchase information to my registration page, I asked Professor Port for help and he provided a great explanation on what went wrong, so I was able to fix it fairly quickly. 

*How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?*

I'd say this assignment was more technical since assignment 2 mainly focus on creating the look for the website and data validation. Overall, less code was required but more critical thinking was needed.

*Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging*

(a) 50% thinking
(b) 10% writing code
(c) 40% testing and debugging
                                                                                            
*Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?*

What worked well with this project was creating a login page that was successful in redirecting the user to an invoice that displayed their purchased products. In contrast, creating a registration page that did the same thing was difficult considering it redirects the user to the success page and then the invoice page which made it harder to transfer purchase data over. 
                                                                                            
*If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?*

If I could do things differently, I would personalize and use CSS to make the invoice page more appealing since right now, it looks fairly mediocre.
