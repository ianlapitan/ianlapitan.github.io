*UI Basics Technical Essay*

The WODs were a great learning experience. For my first attempt at Browserhistory1, I hit DNF because there were simple mistakes I made which caused me to be stuck for quite a while, but generally the instructions were pretty straightforward. After watching the screencast, I did my second attempt and it went well as it took me around 23 minutes, although I did have to use AI for a method to link the style sheet to html. The screencast was extremely helpful so I recommend watching it carefully and understanding the concepts of all the code before doing your second attempt

On Browserhistory2, I found that there were less tasks, but more technical concepts. My first attempt initially was going well, but I got frustrated at trying to put the Oswald text for the headers. On my second attempt, though the Oswald text still didn't seem to appear, I still had an idea on how to implement it to the webserver from the screencast. However, I reccommend you reach out for help if you run into issues like this because it could easily be a minor fix. 

Lastly, Browserhistory3 was a little more challenging with again, even less tasks, but more technical concepts. This one took me 3 attempts, as I hit DNF the first and the second attempt even after watching the screencast. One thing I struggled with that had me stuck for several minutes was spacing out my navigation bar at the top of the page. Before my third attempt, I used AI to give me an idea on how to do this task since the method screencast provided did not work on my web server. This allowed me to complete the WOD around 13 minutes in.
