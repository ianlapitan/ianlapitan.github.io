*About Me:*

Hello, my name is Ian Lapitan and I'm an MIS major at the University of Hawai'i with 
plans of declaring a double major in Markting as well. In my first semester of college
I was a Computer Science major, but I eventually changed my major as it was a little 
challenging for me, but I did still enjoy coding. During this time, MIS caught my attention
since it dealt with coding AND business which are two things that interests me. My journey 
from Computer Science to MIS reflects my passion for both coding and business,
driving my decision to pursue a double major in MIS and Marketing at the University of Hawai'i.
