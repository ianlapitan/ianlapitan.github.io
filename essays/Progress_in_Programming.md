*Progress in Programming*

My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:

I am able to create basic for loops, if, and else statements. I understand the functionality of specific functions and can perform them such as something as basic as a console.log or Math.floor, to a document.getElementbyID. I am also proficient in styling in css to make sure my programs aren't
disorganized or unpleasent to look at. 

I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:

I need to work on creating more advanced loops. For example, in Assignment1 I wanted to create a loop that would create a row for every 4 products,and I found it quite difficult to do so, and I eventually used AI to help me with this. 

I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:

I'm able to do a lot of the earlier WODs without the screencast but more challenging WODs such as Smartphoneproducts3 and Invoice3 would require me to reference the screencast. Although I do need the screencasts sometimes, I use these WOD experiences to learn and improve.

The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:

Yes, the labs have been extremely helpful in my programming journey as they give me insight and basic knowledge on how certain programming concepts 
function before I use them in WODs and our Assignments. 

I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:

Yes, Assignment1 has proved to be quite challenging and required a lot guidance from my peers, the TA's, and the professor, but it overall was an eye-opening learning 
experience that provides a sense of clarity for how Assignment 2 is going to be difficulty-wise as well as functionality. All things considered, Assignment1 and the
recent lab has prepared me well for Assignment2.

I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:

I think if the class was more interactive and more video examples were provided of specific programming concepts, my learning experience could be improved. Additionally
I think focusing the lecture on the more important concepts could be more beneficial than spending much time on functions that may not be used in class or in general. 


What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):

One on one help, WODs, and screencasts have been extremely helpful in this class. When professor goes in depth on the important programming concepts in his screencasts, I find myself to be more engaged and process the information quite well to apply it in my work.
